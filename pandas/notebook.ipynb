    "\n",
    "This tool is essentially your data’s home. Through pandas, you get acquainted with your data by cleaning, transforming, and analyzing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you want to explore a dataset stored in a CSV on your computer. Pandas will extract the data from that CSV into a DataFrame — a table, basically — then let you do things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate statistics and answer questions about the data, like\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - What's the average, median, max, or min of each column? \n",
    "    - Does column A correlate with column B?\n",
    "    - What does the distribution of data in column C look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean the data by doing things like removing missing values and filtering rows or columns by some criteria\n",

You don’t have to be at the level of the software engineer, but you should be adept at the basics, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, functions, and iterations. Also, I’d also recommend familiarizing yourself with **NumPy** due to the similarities mentioned above.\n"
